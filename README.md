# Technical Interview Challenge

## Goals

Implement mock API functions to sort and combine data into UI friendly formats. 

- Follow Comments to understand and complete tasks
- Styling is optional, but will be looked at if added
- Functions and Components can be made at your discretion (write the way you percieve to be clean code)
- While the app is setup using typescript, new files can be created as JS(X) and code inside TS(X) can leave off typescript aspects if desired. Write in the code you are most comfortable with. 
- When you have completed all that you want, push the code to a new branch with your name
- Branch will be reviewed, deleted, and then an outreach email will be sent your way.
- Happy Coding ðŸŽ‰
